# deep-learning-portfolio-optimization

The idea is to implement portfolio optimization with deep learning. We start off with building a deep learning portfolio optimization technique and we compare its performance with other portfolio optimization methods including Black-Litterman, mean-variance optimization and an all-weather portfolio. We researched CNNs and FCNs but ultimately chose to analyze an LSTM modelâ€™s performance for our paper. We hope that this paper can offer an introduction to traditional portfolio optimization and an exploration of machine learning applications.
